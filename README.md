Prestige Native for IOS

Prestige - A Music Social Media Revolution 🎵✨

Prestige is an app that redefines how we experience, share, and connect over music. At its core, Prestige assigns a level of prestige based on the time you spend with your favorite albums, songs, and artists. Compete with friends, share your unique music journey, and use your listening habits as a conversation starter.

🌟 Key Features:

Compare Prestiges: See how your dedication to music stacks up against your friends.
Spotify Integration: Seamlessly connect to Spotify's API for efficient, real-time data updates.
Social Connections: Discover your friends’ music tastes and gain deeper insights into their personalities through shared listening.
Earn Rewards: Unlock cosmetic badges and achievements for your listening milestones.
Live Feed: Stay in the loop with what your friends are currently vibing to on Spotify.
🧠 Inspired by Maslow's Peak Experiences: Abraham Maslow identified music as a universal pathway to peak human experiences – moments of joy, connection, and self-realization. Prestige builds on this idea, creating a space where music is not just listened to but celebrated and shared.

🎶 Why Prestige? In 2025, music has become a lifestyle for millions globally. Despite the explosion of streaming platforms and fandoms, there’s no single community where music lovers can come together, share their passion, and dive deep into the magic of music. Prestige fills this gap by fostering connection through:

Sharing your music taste.
Competing with fellow fans to prove your dedication.
Learning about others through their unique playlists and preferences.
🛠️ Built For Music Lovers By Music Lovers: Your music is more than background noise—it’s your story, told in melodies and rhythms. Prestige is a platform where you’re not defined by photos or followers, but by the beats that resonate with your soul.

Let’s make music more social, more meaningful, and more connected. 🎧
