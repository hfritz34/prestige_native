## üéØ What is Prestige?

Prestige redefines how we experience, share, and connect over music on iOS. At its core, Prestige assigns levels of "prestige" based on the time you spend with your favorite albums, songs, and artists. Think of it as gamifying your music listening - compete with friends, rate your music, share your unique music journey, and use your listening habits as the ultimate conversation starter.

## üß† Philosophical Foundation

> *Inspired by Abraham Maslow's Peak Experiences*

Abraham Maslow identified music as a universal pathway to peak human experiences ‚Äì moments of joy, connection, and self-realization. Prestige builds on this idea, creating a space where music is not just listened to but celebrated and shared.

## üé∂ Why Prestige Matters
