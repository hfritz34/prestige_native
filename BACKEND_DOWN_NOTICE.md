# Backend API Status Notice

## Current Issue
Backend API is returning 500.30 errors: "ASP.NET Core app failed to start"

**URL**: https://prestigeapi-gbdzagg5e4a3aahc.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net
**Status**: DOWN üî¥

## iOS App Impact
- Authentication works ‚úÖ
- API calls fail with 500 errors ‚ùå
- iOS optimizations cannot be tested until backend is restored

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Backend Service
Go to Azure Portal ‚Üí App Service ‚Üí Restart

### 2. Check Recent Deployments
The backend may have failed after recent optimization deployments.

### 3. Verify New Features
Once backend is restored, verify:
- [ ] New batch endpoint: `POST /api/library/items/batch`
- [ ] Rate limiting configuration
- [ ] Redis caching service
- [ ] Database migrations

## iOS App Status
‚úÖ **iOS optimizations are complete and ready**:
- Batch API integration implemented
- Image caching with fallback
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Response caching service
- Performance monitoring

The iOS app will automatically benefit from backend optimizations once the service is restored.

## Testing Without Backend
To test iOS optimizations independently:
1. Use mock data in development
2. Test image caching with external URLs
3. Verify cache performance locally

**Next action**: Restart the Azure backend service.
